# EMNLP 2020

!!! WORK IN PROGRESS !!!

In this blog post I will describe my experience at the [2020 Conference on Empirical Methods in Natural Language Processing](https://2020.emnlp.org/), that took place virtually between Nov 16 and Nov 20. 

It was my first academic ML or NLP conference and I really had a great time. I committed most of my week to the conference and also extended it to the weekend, so that I have two more days to catch up on some papers and talks that I missed during the week. The amount of content that the conference offers in incredible, 752 main conference papers, 25 workshops, 7 tutorials and 5 plenary sessions. Additionally, the conference had plenty of Q&A, gather and demo sessions with paper authors that offer a chance to interact and socialize. 

Below I will write about some of my personal highlights from the conference. Of course this only reflects a small subset of the many possibilities. In my role as self-employed NLP data scientist, which necessarily puts me more in the position of a generalist rather than a deeply specialized researcher, I decided to attend as many plenary sessions, tutorials and workshops as possible to get a broad overview of the field and its progress. Even though I'm still relatively new to the field (with a bit more than two years of working in NLP), I could follow along the highly technical content without any problems. I had a somewhat harder time at Q&A and gather sessions, which require detailed knowledge of each discussed topic as well as having read the paper in advance or at least having watched the pre-recorded paper talk. Next time I participate in a virtual conference, I will definitely take a day or two before it starts to better prepare and select the papers I want to learn more about.
