# NLP Summit 2020

[Note: This blog post is work in progress]

I want to kick off this blog by describing my impressions and take-aways from attending the [NLP Summit 2020: Applied Natural Language Processing](https://www.nlpsummit.org/) which took place virtually between October 6th and 9th. [John Snow Labs](https://www.johnsnowlabs.com/), the main creator behind [Spark NLP](https://github.com/JohnSnowLabs/spark-nlp) and organizer of the summit put together a diverse and interesting program for the four conference days.

I will divide this blog post into three sections:
1. The state of Applied NLP in 2020
2. The importance of data annotation
3. My personal highlights

## 1. The state of Applied NLP in 2020

- NLP budgets increasing
- Which tools are around? 
- Which libraries are most used?
- Why is NLP tansformational? 
- Off the shelve tools don't work. Still need to train or fine-tune on custom data
- General use cases: text classification, NER
- Specific use cases: de-identification, summarization and classification in legal, chatbots, 

## 2. The importance of data annotation

- Multiple labelers, consensus
- Alignment sessions with team and clients
- Define and review clear annotation guidelines
- Use domain experts for annotation!
- Use annotation tools! Prodigy or in-house
- Aim for high IAA (Inter annotator agreement)

## 3. My personal highlights

- Christine Gerpheide (CTO @ Bespoke): NLP research to production
- Moshe Wasserblat (NLP & DL Research Manager @ Intel): Efficient DL NLP in production
