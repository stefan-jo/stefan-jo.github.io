# NLP Summit 2020

[Note: This blog post is work in progress]

I want to kick off this blog by describing my impressions and take-aways from attending the [NLP Summit 2020: Applied Natural Language Processing](https://www.nlpsummit.org/) which took place virtually between October 6th and 9th. [John Snow Labs](https://www.johnsnowlabs.com/), the main creator behind the [Spark NLP library](https://github.com/JohnSnowLabs/spark-nlp) and organizer of the summit put together a diverse and interesting program for the four conference days.

I will divide this blog post into three sections:
1. The state of Applied NLP in 2020
2. The importance of data annotation
3. My three personal highlights

## 1. The state of Applied NLP in 2020
