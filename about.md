# About

I am a self-studied data scientist and machine learning practicioner. I obtained my M.Sc. in Economics from Stockholm University and spent  two years as a technical project manager working on digitization and business intelligence projects in industry. With some statistical programming background in R and Matlab, I decided to enter the exciting field of machine learning by myself in 2016. I completed many MOOCs in Python and machine learning, of which I would like to mention and recommend the fantastic courses from [deeplearning.ai](https://www.deeplearning.ai/deep-learning-specialization/) and [fast.ai](https://www.fast.ai). Currently I'm working as self-employed machine learning consultant by solving small data NLP problems with deep learning and transfer learning. 

I'm from the beautiful town of Regensburg, Germany, but the center of my life is now the even more beautiful Prague, Czech Republic. I like guitars, hiking, Bruce Springsteen, enjoying a beer with friends, traveling to Spain, skiing and many other things. I try to teach Czech to machines and to myself. And I really hope you will enjoy some of my blog posts.
