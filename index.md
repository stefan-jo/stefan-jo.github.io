Hello and welcome to my blog! 

There are many good reasons to start your own blog: Improving your technical writing skills, sharing what you have learned with the community or showcasing your work to potential employers, clients or collaborators. I highly recommend Rachel Thomas' article [Why you (yes, you) should blog](https://medium.com/@racheltho/why-you-yes-you-should-blog-7d2544ac1045) that motivated me to start my own blog. 

On this blog I want to share personal projects covering data science, machine learning and natural language processing, as well as thoughts on topics such as AI project management, data ethics and how AI affects the economy and society. 

What I have planned for the upcoming months:
- Kick off this blog by summing up my impressions from the [NLP Summit 2020](https://www.nlpsummit.org/) 
- Write a series of posts with lessons learned from reading [Building Machine Learning Powered Applications: Going from Idea to Product](https://www.oreilly.com/library/view/building-machine-learning/9781492045106/) by Emmanuel Ameisen
- Write a tutorial on building a state-of-the-art multi-label classification model for multi-lingual texts using [huggingface transformers](https://huggingface.co/transformers/)
- Complete a tabular kaggle competition and share my results here, e.g. the [Santander Value Prediction Challenge](https://www.kaggle.com/c/santander-value-prediction-challenge/data)
- Dig deeper into the brand-new [fastai v2](https://docs.fast.ai/) library and share my insights
- Train a BERT language model from scratch and share it on the [huggingface model hub](https://huggingface.co/models)
