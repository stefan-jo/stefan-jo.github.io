Hello and welcome to my blog! 

There are many good reasons to start your own blog: Improving your technical writing skills, sharing what you have learned with the community or showcasing your work to potential employers, clients or collaborators. I highly recommend the article [Why you (yes, you) should blog](https://medium.com/@racheltho/why-you-yes-you-should-blog-7d2544ac1045) by Rachel Thomas that motivated me to start my own blog. 

On this blog I want to share personal projects covering data science, machine learning and natural language processing, as well as thoughts on topics such as AI project management, data ethics and how AI affects the economy and society. 

Please check out my first blog posts:
- I kicked off this blog by summing up my impressions from the [NLP Summit 2020](https://www.nlpsummit.org/) 
- My second blog post describes my experience at [EMNLP 2020](https://2020.emnlp.org/) (work in progress)

Feel free to also look at two projects from earlier this year: 
- [Sentiment analysis](https://github.com/stefan-jo/USAirlineSent/blob/master/tweets_ULMFit_final.ipynb) with Universal Language Model Fine-tuning for Text classification
- Building an [image recognition webapp](https://github.com/stefan-jo/guitar_classifier/blob/master/guitar_classifier_model.ipynb) with fastai v2, Jupyter, Voil√† and Binder

What I have planned for the upcoming months:
- Write an in-depth tutorial for fastai v2 text, showing details like subword tokenization, multi-label classification, QRNN and inference
- Train a BERT language model from scratch in a new language and share it on the [huggingface model hub](https://huggingface.co/models)
- When the new fast.ai Deep Learning course part 2 comes out, I plan to follow along here with posting projects and tutorials

Head over to [About](https://stefan-jo.github.io/about.html) to find out more about me or dive straight into the posts below. 

Please let me know your feedback!
